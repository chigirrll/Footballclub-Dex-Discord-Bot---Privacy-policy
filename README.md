You may check the source code and see how the data is managed, in addition to the following policy.

## What data is collected

Footballclub Dex collects the following data from Discord:

- User IDs, this is used to identify you inside our database
- Server (or guild) IDs, this is used to store settings necessary to the bot's operation
- Channel IDs, this is used to know in which channel should the collectibles spawn

In addition, the following data proper to Footballclub Dex is created and used:

- The list of collectibles owned by a user of the service
- A history of trades done on collectibles, including the users that once owned the said collectible but do not anymore
- Various settings configured by an individual user or the server, such as player policies or spawn silent option

The bot has access to the content of messages but is used solely for the purpose of anti-cheat and the said content is not stored longer than necessary for the analysis (under one second). Message content is never cached or stored, and cannot be accessed by the administrators to read your messages.

## How the data is stored

All persistent data is stored on a PostgreSQL database, runnning on the Application's Owner computer.

Interaction between the bot and the database server is exclusively local using [Tortoise ORM](https://github.com/tortoise/tortoise-orm).

## Access to the data

The only people allowed to access the data are the application owners.

Any application owner may interact with the bot and the administrator interface.

The Footballclub Dex moderation teams do not have access to the data.

The data may never be made available to the public, and its access must be secured accordingly.

## Your rights

You may request a copy or the deletion of your personal data held by the application by contacting the application owners. The recommended way is by submitting a ticket in the [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/SHB44XjEBZ) (#【📮】tickets channel).

- The user accepted the extra clause via `/player consent`
- The message is replying to the bot with a spawned collectible
- The user is not blacklisted

If all the conditions above are true, the message will be uploaded to Google API for text recognition. The data is not saved by FC Dex or Google afterwards.
